 # My Transition into Cloud Security
i've been learning azure for a while along the way i interacted with Aws for a while so here are my documented two cents on everything. i hope this will help someone 
This repo will contain some of the thing i consider to have been invaluable in cloud security roadmap.

# Tips on how to get started with Cloud Security
- Be ready to learn and stay open minded!, might sound like the cliche thing you hear out here but it really holds.
- curate a roadmap for yourself. What do you want to achieve adn hwo should you go about it. this will help silence the outside noises when you're feeling overwhelmed or lost
- important thing you'll need to learn when it comes to cloud security; safe to note you can approach things from an agonstic point of view or you can be cloud specific:
  - Learn the cloud you want to work with indepth!! if its azure, aws or gcp get your basics in order they'll help you understand how you can incorporate security practices.
  - Learn Cloud security from an agonstic point of view (i'll attach resources/books i used to learn) know the how security in the cloud is structured into; IAM Security, Network Security, Data Security, Endpoint Security...

  - Get a cloud subscription and start getting familiar with things on the cloud.
  - Provision things from th eportal and don't forget to clean up reources once you're done, avoid being billed for things you forgot to delete.
  - Learn Infrastructure as Code; working on the cloud mean syou have to be good at provisioning things fast and especially when you need to provision many resources at a go. 
    IaC will come in handy. While at it learn IaC security practices.
  - Choose the career you want in the cloud. There are plenty of options to choose from:
      - Cloud Security Engineer
      - Cloud Pentester
      - Cloud Detection Engineer
      - Cloud Solutions Architect....etc.
   - Choose the certification you'll write relevant to your path;
      - AZ 900 for fundamentals
      - SC 900 or SC 100 or SC200
      - AZ 500 for Security Engineers
      - AZ 305 for Solutions Architects
    - Attend info sec community hangouts to network, meet people in your field who you can learn from or they can mentor you.
